Step 1: Install Prerequisites:
   - Make sure you have Java JDK installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
   - Install an integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Step 2: Clone the Project:
   - Clone the Spring project from the GitHub repository to your local machine using Git.

Step 3: Import Project into IDE:
   - Open the IDE and import the cloned project as a Maven project.

Step 4: Set Up Database :
   - If the application uses a database, set up the necessary database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) locally or use an in-memory database like H2 for testing.

Step 5: Configure Application Properties:
   - Review the application properties file (e.g., application.properties or application.yml) to ensure it is correctly configured for your local environment, including database connection details.

Step 6: Build the Project:
   - Build the Spring project using Maven. This step will download the required dependencies.

Step 7: Run the Application:
   - Run the Spring Boot application from the IDE by selecting the main class (usually annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`) and clicking the "Run" button.

Step 8: Verify the Application:
   - Once the application starts, verify that it is running correctly by checking the logs for any errors or exceptions.
   - Access the application endpoints through a web browser or use Postman to send HTTP requests and verify the responses.

Step 9: Test the Endpoints:
   - Use Postman or any other REST client to test the endpoints of the application to ensure they are functioning as expected.

Step 10: Make Changes:
   - If you encounter any issues or want to make changes to the application, do so in the IDE and rerun the application to see the effect of your changes.

Step 11: Stop the Application:
   - Stop the application when you are done testing and development.
